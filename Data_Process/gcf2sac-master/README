_A Python script to convert the new .gcf files added to a specific directory_

Author: 'Patricio Palma Solis <mail@ppalma.cl>'

 Introducion

Sort and convert large numbers of files can be tedious for a user.

For them by joining the converter gcf2sac and pynotify features,
you can perform this task automatically.

Only a pattern in the name of the original files.


== Documentation ==




== Using ==

Assuming that the original files are arranged in specific directories 
and specific name in this way

	/some/path/location/station/date_timeStationComponent.gcf

example:  
	/home/user/gcffiles/Hudson/Huds/20110621_1300hude.gcf
	/home/user/gcffiles/Hudson/Huds/20110621_1300hudn.gcf
	/home/user/gcffiles/Hudson/Huds/20110621_1300hudz.gcf


And the converted file should be saved in a new directory 
with the following structure 
	
	/some/path/Cdate/date_timeStationComponent.sac

example:
	/home/user/sacfiles/C20110621/20110621_1300hude.sac
	/home/user/sacfiles/C20110621/20110621_1300hudn.sac
	/home/user/sacfiles/C20110621/20110621_1300hudz.sac
